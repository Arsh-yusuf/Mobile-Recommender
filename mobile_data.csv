Writing this review after a month usage. Bought it in BBD for 38k.1) Display : top notch, touch is like butter smooth2) Camera : In better lightimg conditions photos are exceptional while in low light it struggles a bit. Portrait mode is awesome. 3) Battery : i use to charge for 85% and it lasts for a day. Fast charge is superb. Frm 10 - 85% charge, it takes around 50mins. I DON'T FIND NY HEATING ISSUE.. Everything is great except the battery , doesn't even last 12 hrs or even 8 hrs if used properly, have to charge multiple times 🥲. Amazing product under 40k , i like it , FANTASTIC performance,  decent phone with great performance, looks,cameras etc.. Camera is super good.... decent performance.... battery drains really fast and heating issue is still there but it has been resolved to some extent. Good phone...... Phone is very Handy and camera Quality is awesome and 16bit Raw click is make this phone killer in this price segment. Due havy processor some time it get heating Issue but it manageable. Over-all Phone performance of this phone is Excellent.. Product is good very handy good display but need to improve on battery as it does not last whole day. The only drawback is HEATING which causes rapid decrease in battery percentage and ANDROID 13 adds more jolt to it. Hope that company optimises this through a stable update.

Its strongest characteristics are without a doubt the amazingly long battery life and the long software support, which is not standard for the mid-range market. In other words, if you are searching for a phone that would not break the bank and nevertheless last you for 3 or 4 years, this is a great option.P.... Best phone under this price .Camera 👌.

It's the form factor that is the main selling point (and talking point) of this phone.

The phone is very good, love the small size of it.

I ordered my iPhone on 11th Oct and I received it before the given time, which was an absolutely remarkable job by Flipkart.Firstly I wanna address some rumors around this particular device 1) Heating issues NO2) Charging related issues - NO3) Any issues I encountered - NO4) Rumors were just exaggerated by people - DEFINITELY YESLastly I wanna say that it is A BEAST in performance, camera is also superb, believe me go with this product and you wont regret.

Very Nice. Best iphone yet. Have been using 5s for the past 4 years and finally decided to upgrade to XS Max, Inspite of the big size it still feels so convenient due to its brilliant structure and no doubt it provides a superior performance based on every aspect. The Gold variant definitely gives an elegant feel when you hold it, though it would have been great if apple included a fast charger considering the price tag.Also, a special thanks to Flipkart for a quick delivery!. The product is amazing. Only thing Flipkart could have done better was the packaging of the product as it’s an electronic item and has to be handled with care. There should be an extra box, but anyway got the mobile phone in the best condition possible.. Best phone in year of 2018 👌🏻👍👍👍👍🤫. Flipkart service is very good .

It's a good option if you want to buy into the iOS ecosystem and currently using an Android or an iPhone 7 or below.Dont think it's worth upgrading from an X.

This product is really good and the main highlight part  it's camera part and glossy look and performance wise it's also good 👍🏻😊. In one word mini DSLR. Everything is perfect .Design 5/5Camera out of the world 🤩🤩🤩battery 4/5 u can spend one day easliy with single charge if you are not a gamer.One thing it could be better if there was dual stereo speaker provided although speaker is loud but not so pleasing to hear.Otherwise phone is fabulous if you able to purchase it with discount.Aura light do its job very well and differentiate it from all other phones which is available in this price range.U can definately.... Best Camera phone. Superb phone.Love the display and camera is dslr like..

First time buying a Vivo phone .. always was a samsung fan....now I switched to Vivo....man the camera is awesome especially the telephoto lens... Vivo does magic with the zoom even 10x is really crisp and performs exactly like s22 ultra optical lens.... I don't know how but low-light photos are really impressive and beats samsung and my Nikon mirror less..... Now I will always buy vivo. Absolutely King of photography Excellent 👌👌👌CameraDisplayPremium smartphoneBatteryEverything is top class. Night Photoshoot GiantI was using Realme X2 Pro for the past 4 years and the phone was running fluid but recently at my friend's sister's marriage I realised why I badly needed a camera centric mobile. All photos came out with horrendous lens flare and I made up my mind for a camera specific Android phone. I did extensive research between Xiaomi 14 pro, OnePlus 12 and Vivo X100 pro. When I saw daylight and night portraits and videos choosing Vivo X100pro came on top for its night photoshoot.... Hardware as expected, Awesome.Mind blowing cameras.However, Vivo must enhance their software game, same ui that you get in budget segment with some ads that you can never turn off.. Bought this week, haven't used much so far but it turns out to be a good Purchase. Fantastic Camera (One of the Best in the Market), Massive Battery Life/Super Quick Charging. Enclosing a few unedited shots for reference.. Just go for it without any second thought..😍😍. As always X series rocks, i m upgrading from x70 pro, so most of the features I have already experienced. Good to see the improvements. primium quality for imges camera and mobile also I liked 💯. Very much satisfied with the X100 pro. Very powerful camera. Nice display. Fast charging. Bang for the money. Upgraded from Vivo X70PRO+. Loved the device..",16.0,512.0,17.22,50

I recently purchased the Oppo N2 Find Flip, a clamshell flip phone, and after using it extensively, I would rate it 4 stars. I bought it for 78k, and here's why I believe it deserves this rating:Pros:1. Minimal crease: When the phone is open, the crease in the middle is significantly less noticeable compared to the Samsung Galaxy Flip 4. This gives the Oppo N2 Find Flip a more seamless and aesthetically pleasing display.2. Big and bright cover screen: The cover screen on the Oppo N2 Find ....

Display and the DESIGN ARE THE KEY FEATURES OF THIS PHONE . specially the cover screen is op.. overall BEST FILP PHONE IN MARKET till now.Cons. Wireless charge and ip rating are not their.. No doubt about the phone. Blindly we can choose this phone. Please don't prefer the Flipkart exchange offer. You will not get offered amount as mentioned in the order. It will be reduced while assessing the old phone even your old phone is in good condition and appearing as brand new phone. I'm well experienced in this. This Appo phone was very good.. Dear All, Recently i have purchased this handset from Flipkart, No dought the phone is good but not great, the main issue which I am facing is the heat problem. Even in 15 mint charge the phone catch the heat issue. Even if you talk with anyone in 15 to 20 mint call this phone catch too much heat.  If there will be any blast issue?

I could have given negative rating if there is an option.The phone started to hang in the 2nd week itself.I'm getting calls but I'm unable to see who is calling me and those call are also not recorded in the calls log. so sometimes I miss some of the important calls.Keyboard stops responding while chatting, and neither I could type anything nor I could lock my phone... I had to forcefully shut it down and restart the device to use it.In the normal use also, phone lags very much..The rat.... Its was ok ok. I wouldn't take this phone even for FREE. Such pathetic product, charging and heating issues , battery gets drained immediately, ram is 6gb but the device is hanging, touch is very unresponsive, takes 7-8mins to restart. I cnt believe this is a 6gb phone, my old 4gb ram phone of 3 years now, works much much better than this. Pathetic product. Shame on Redmi and even Flipkart. AMOGH SELLER IS A FRAUD, they literally don't care if they send defective pieces. I've been liaising with Flipkart sin....",6.0,128.0,16.59,13
